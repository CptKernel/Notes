6/4/18:
	- Got everything setup today. Need to continue watching the plural sight videos for the on boarding. Following along. 
		I did not make it very far in the actual following along part yet, but tomorrow should be easy going. I got up to 
		making the app service in the videos. Didn't want to actually start it until tomorrow when I could actually 
		follow through and finish the tutorial. These videos are for developing with .NET on Microsoft Azure. 
6/5/18:
	- Ran into an issue with being directly connected to the Internet at dfs because I had restricted access to the 
		socket I needed. Cant remember the exact issue that I was having that caused me to have to disconnect.
	- Had to figure out how the entity framework migrations worked in order to get my azure SQL database to work and update
		properly. Can see some user information through visual studio, and the tables set up there were set up automatically
		by the entity framework migration. 
	- Started to work on the CosmosDB but unfortunately Allen Scot left out a lot of the coding that I will need to follow 
		along and it is taking me way to long to replicate. Going to skip following these parts on the later half of section 5.
	- I stopped on section 6 for today as he was going over ImagesController. All my code should be done associated with 
		that though. Finish this path tomorrow!
6/6/18: 
	- Found the issue that I had with the network. I was not able to push anything with git while directly connected to 
		the Internet. Ran into an issue creating extra tabs on the nav bar of the website. Solved by comparing my files 
		with Scott's. 
	- Had to copy 2 lines over from the Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml doc. Spent way to long trying to get my courses
		menu to work. I was missing a statement in my startup.cs file. Under the //Add application services comment. 
	- Internet went down so I called it a day right as I got back up to the Functions in azure. The website is fully 
		functioning now. 
6/7/18:
	- Completed the first path today. Very little problems except for the last part of the course where I would have needed
		more permissions to set up the release phase in visual studio team services. 
	- Also I could not get the cognitive facial API to spit out information on my actual website once I had uploaded a 
		picture 
	- Starting the next path on Plural Sight, this on is on cloud patterns and architecture.
	- Unable to follow along with the cloud and architecture videos because he is using the release service provided by the 
		visual studio team services that I cannot set up because I do not have the required permissions to do so. So for now
		I am just following along and taking notes.
	- Stopped for the day on the scalability section of the course.
6/8/18:
	- Got through most of the cloud and architecture videos today. Ending on the testing module
	- Richie gave us a brief run down of what Donnelley does and how the inner workings work.
6/11/18:
	- Started the OWASP top ten videos but stopped to watch something else.
	- Watched and finished the c# .NET tutorials on plural sight. Very helpful with some questions I had earlier.
	- Started watching the C# ASP.NET Core videos. Did not finish. 
6/12/18:
	- Continue watching the ASP.NET Core videos, Hoping to finish them today. 
	- Stopped on the ASP.NET Core videos and switched back to the OWASP videos. Figured I didn't need to much understanding 
		to learn about security threats. Trying to get through most of this today so I can stay caught up with everyone else
6/13/18:
	- Goal for today is to get through the rest of the OWASP top 10 and then work on the ASP.NET Core videos some more. 
	- Heard about proxy tool Fiddler. Look into for later possibly. 
	- Made it through the OWASP videos. Got to an alright stopping point on the ASP.NET framework videos. 
6/14/18:
	- Planning on finishing the video set today if at all possible. 
	- Finished the building secure services and applications video series by the glorious Scott Allen.
	- Got close to finishing. I think I have like 2 more hours left of the videos to get through. 
6/15/18:
	- Really actually going to finish the videos today. Listening to Deberah. Its quite awful
	- Finished all of the videos! Going to find some more stuff to brush up on for the rest of the day.
	- Talked with other interns for a while after about jobs and school and everything. 
6/18/18:
	- Had a meeting with Richie about the architecture of the programs that ArcSuite is working and and he then gave us a 
		high level overview of what our project was going to be. 
	- Started looking more into Git at Richie's request. Need to look more into Angular as well. He says that is what we will
		be doing a lot of for our projects. 
	- Meeting at 2:30 till 3:30 today over agile processes. After that there will be another meeting over Git repos. Ryan 
		went over the agile stuff and Jack went over the Git stuff. 
	- Deleted my resource groups on azure today as well seeing how I am now done with all of those videos. 
6/19/18:
	- Got the template for the UI today. We started to look at azure search more and we got it to work through an ASP.Net 
		core application through the azure search SDK. 
	- Ran into an issue with the azure storage explorer. Not sure what the issue is, but I will try to figure it out again
		tomorrow. 
6/20/18:
	- Continued working on the tour of heroes to learn more about angular today. 
	- Met with Richie to discuss what he have done with the Azure search at 10:30 today. Did not get to look over the code 
		that we had yet. Meeting again soon. This meeting he discussed::
			> He talked about figuring out what all the options did in the portal
			> Need to look into testing code before release. Recommended book: Clean Coder
			> What to expect in the real world
			> Solution owners and what they do
	- We figured out how to get everything basically automated in the .Net application
6/21/18:
	- Kept doing the tour of heroes in the morning and looked into the azure search SDK and the config files for that.
	- Looked at unit testing info and tutorials. 
	- Met with Richie to go over code for the Azure search.
6/22/18:
	- Today was spent looking at testing in Angular. 
	- We also were curious about why we are using Angular over React so we looked into that a little more as well
	- Richie worked from home today so it was a little bit of a struggle to continue to find things to look into. Not that
		we don't have enough to learn as of right now but until we start using our new knowledge on the project it is hard 
		to retain the information. 
6/25/18:
	- Talked with Tim about CosmosDb and the stuff people might be searching for within it. 
	- Make the first mock up of the ag grid that we are using. We used hard coded info from the audit database. Need to make
		the search bar for it still. It does not have to work with everything else yet. 
6/26/18:
	- Worked on the audit searches navbar in angular and got that done
	- Figured out a lot of stuff fro git and committed and pushed my changes
	- Wrote the tests I needed for my navbar
6/27/18:
	- Did a pull request into the master branch this morning from the F-ag-search-ui. 
	- Started working on the back-end of the audit search page and planned out a lot of the structure so we can get started
		tomorrow. 
	- Decided to make a model for the audit data we will be using so we can interpret the information that Azure search will
		give back to us. 
6/28/18:
	- Worked on the back-end of the search stuff today. Got done with the basic stuff but we still need to write tests for
		our code. 
6/29/18:
	- Going to be writing the unit tests for the back-end today. Need to figure out mock and xUnit. These are the testing 
		tools that we will be using for our unit tests.
	- Moq it used to make testing easier when there are dependencies in the methods or classes. Super useful to know. Unit 
		tests are something I should work on using more often in my everyday code. 
7/2/18:
	- Started the day off looking at dependency injection and moq. 
	- Worked on getting the front end testing working. 
	- Made a PR into the master branch and started to work on the recommended changes that Tim had for us. 
7/3/18:
	- Waited on the front end code to be reviewed.
	- Worked on adding a loading bar for when someone searches. 
7/5/18:
	- Waited on front end review and had Tim help us with the appsettings.json files
	- Started working on the back-end code for a date range filter
7/6/18:
	- Finished the back-end code for the date time filter and made a pull request.
		- Code is conditional on whether or not the start date and end date are passed in through the query string. 
		- The above logic may have to be changed because I am using the String.IsNullOrEmpty and we may want the user to be
			able to have the end date empty or the start date empty. This will be patched later after we talk with Richie
	- Waiting on hearing back from Richie on where to go next with the application. 
7/9/18:
	- Waiting on someone to give us some direction on where to go next with this project. 
	- While I have been waiting I am working on some Dynamic Programming problems.
	- Talked with Richie and then began setting up continuous integration and deployment. When we built from CI it broke.
7/10/18:
	- Worked on making it so that the user can enter partial searches. This was done using a regex. 
	- We made the search box twice as big.
	- Started looking into server side paging.
7/11/18:
	- I worked on fixing bugs with the search and making it so that currentValue and newValue would show up when people 
		searched for things.
	- Looked into Dependency injection more today and specifically Structure map since that is what the company is using for
		their dependency injection. 
7/12/18:
	- Fixed more bugs with the site and updated the development branch. It is a good idea to have a nice structure for how 
		you want your source control to work before you set it up and start working. It is a pain to keep switching after 
		everyone already has started working.
7/13/18:
	- Tried to refactor the code to make better use of dependency injection. Its a mess of dependencies right now. 
	- Messed around with python and the command line for a while, while we waited on the pull request to be reviewed
7/16/18:
	- Finished the pull request. 
	- Fixed a bug with the front end stuff. 
7/17/18:
	- Spent all day trying to figure out how to test my logic for the date filter
	- Talked with Tim for a long while and decided to make a factory and that will make it so my code is testable
7/18/18:
	- Made the factory and factory interface in the morning
	- Did a PR for my feat branch into development after I had fixed some logic
	- Fixed a bug with dateTo logic and empty search results
	- Made a PR from development into stage
